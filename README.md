# Fashion-Styling-building-System
We are building a personalised fashion styling app, which provides uses with 5 pieces from our product inventory that we have from our partnerships with fashion retailers.

I am looking for someone to outline the build scope - including technologies, database structures, how we will gain the dataset (we have a cold start situation) thinking using NLP for this and then being able to spearhead the technology building of this system. We want to be a fashion stylist version of tiktok being able to feedback loop insights on an individual basis about style preferences. Operating as a mobile app for Android and IOS these considerations will need to be made to what you build and the connection of APIs from our partnered retailers database.

Key component of this build is also how do we create a model that understands logic around what makes a good outfit, what pieces work well together.

someone who has a solid grasp on how to handle and own the development of this element, whilst the ability to look at the scripts previously created which filter the product database received from retailers in a continuously updated stream I want there to be considerations about the most efficient in speed and cost effective methods for database structure, API's and other elements all working together . A real self-starter and has experience in working with large data sets to understand best approach. Real plus if you're passionate about fashion and have experience in creating something similar.
=========================
 Python-based implementation outline for an application that uses AI technologies to analyze study documents (PDFs), answers user queries in a chatbot style, provides rule-based decision support, and visualizes findings in an interactive dashboard. The solution will utilize AWS or Azure cloud services.
Technology Stack

    Frontend:
        Framework: React.js or Vue.js (for building the interactive dashboard).
        Deployment: AWS Amplify or Azure Static Web Apps.

    Backend:
        Framework: FastAPI or Flask (for handling API requests and processing).
        Hosting: AWS Lambda or Azure Functions (serverless).

    AI & NLP:
        OpenAI GPT models for document Q&A (or AWS Bedrock/Azure OpenAI).
        LangChain for document parsing and query management.
        PyPDF2 or pdfplumber for PDF parsing.

    Data Storage:
        Document Storage: AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
        Metadata Storage: DynamoDB or CosmosDB.
        Query Logs & Statistics: PostgreSQL on RDS (AWS) or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

    Visualization:
        Libraries: Plotly, Dash, or Power BI Embedded (for dashboard visualization).
        Embedding: React.js or Vue.js frontend.

Application Workflow

    Document Upload:
        Users upload PDFs via the frontend.
        Files are stored in S3 (AWS) or Blob Storage (Azure).

    Document Parsing & Analysis:
        Use PyPDF2 to extract text from PDFs.
        Feed text to GPT-based model or LangChain for document indexing.
        Metadata about documents is stored for quick lookup.

    Chatbot Interaction:
        Users ask questions about the uploaded documents.
        Backend queries indexed documents using LangChain and returns answers.

    Rule-Based Decision Support:
        Apply business logic (rules) using Python.
        Integrate AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for scalable decision support.

    Dashboard:
        Visualize analytics, including:
            Usage trends.
            Frequently asked questions.
            Document statistics (e.g., word count, keywords).
        Plotly/Dash for creating interactive components.

Code Implementation
1. Backend: API Development with FastAPI

from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, HTTPException
import boto3
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
import os

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# AWS S3 Configuration
S3_BUCKET = "your-s3-bucket"
s3_client = boto3.client("s3")

# Load OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize LangChain embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_document(file: UploadFile):
    """Endpoint to upload and analyze PDF document."""
    if file.content_type != "application/pdf":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid file format. Please upload a PDF.")

    # Save to AWS S3
    file_path = f"uploads/{file.filename}"
    s3_client.upload_fileobj(file.file, S3_BUCKET, file_path)

    # Load PDF and create index
    loader = PyPDFLoader(f"s3://{S3_BUCKET}/{file_path}")
    docs = loader.load()
    index = VectorstoreIndexCreator(embedding_model=embeddings).from_documents(docs)

    return {"message": "Document uploaded and indexed successfully!"}

@app.post("/query")
async def query_document(question: str):
    """Endpoint for querying indexed documents."""
    try:
        response = index.query(question)
        return {"answer": response}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

2. Dashboard with Plotly/Dash

import dash
from dash import dcc, html
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Document": ["Doc1", "Doc2", "Doc3"],
    "Questions": [15, 10, 5],
    "Keywords": ["AI, Data", "Cloud, Python", "PDF, Azure"]
})

# Initialize Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1("Document Analysis Dashboard"),
    dcc.Graph(
        id="questions-per-document",
        figure=px.bar(data, x="Document", y="Questions", title="Questions per Document")
    ),
    dcc.Graph(
        id="keyword-frequency",
        figure=px.pie(data, names="Document", values="Questions", title="Keyword Distribution")
    )
])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)

3. Deployment with Docker
Dockerfile

# Backend Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["uvicorn", "bot:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

docker-compose.yml

version: "3.8"
services:
  backend:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
